Ingredients

    3 medium russet potatoes, peeled

    1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste

    2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

    1 tablespoon grated onion

    ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste

    ¼ cup peanut oil for frying, or as needed

Directions

    Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place 
    shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible. Measure 2 
    cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add 
    egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined. Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, 
    heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot 
    oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 
    minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you 
    cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.
